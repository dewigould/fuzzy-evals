  --- Problem 1: Convert the point (0,3) in rectangular coordinates to polar ... ---
  Expected: (3,\frac{\pi}{2})
  Response length: 702 chars
  Has \boxed: True
  Full response:
<think>
We are given the rectangular coordinates $(x, y) = (0, 3)$ and need to convert them to polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$, where $r > 0$ and $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$.

---

### Step 1: Find $r$

The formula for $r$ is:
$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

Substitute $x = 0$, $y = 3$:
$$
r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$

---

### Step 2: Find $\theta$

The formula for $\theta$ is:
$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

But here, $x = 0$, so we cannot divide by zero. Instead, we analyze the position:

- The point $(0, 3)$ lies on the **positive $y$-axis**.
- Therefore, the angle $\theta$ is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians (90 degrees).

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{(3, \frac{\pi}{2})}
$$

We are looking for the **least positive integer multiple of 30** that can be written **using only the digits 0 and 2**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the conditions

We want the **smallest positive multiple of 30** such that:
- It is divisible by **30**
- It contains **only digits 0 and 2**

---

### Step 2: Divisibility by 30

Since $ 30 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 $, a number divisible by 30 must be divisible by **2**, **3**, and **5**.

Let’s analyze what this means for a number made only of

4-digit numbers less than 2220:
- 2000 → sum = 2 → no
- 2002 → ends in 2 → invalid
- 2020 → digits: 2,0,2,0 → two 2s → sum = 4 → not divisible by 3 → no
- 2200 → two 2s → sum = 4 → no
- 2220 → three 2s → sum = 6 → divisible by 3 → ends in 0 → valid

So no number less than 2220 satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, **2220** is the smallest such number.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2220}
$$

  Expected: 32
  Response length: 584 chars
  Has \boxed: True
  Full response:
<think>
We are given the expression:

$$
2^{10} \cdot 2^{15}
$$

### Step 1: Use the laws of exponents
When multiplying powers with the same base, add the exponents:

$$
2^{10} \cdot 2^{15} = 2^{10 + 15} = 2^{25}
$$

### Step 2: Express $2^{25}$ as some integer to the fifth power

We want to write $2^{25}$ as $n^5$ for some integer $n$.

So we are looking for $n$ such that:

$$
n^5 = 2^{25}
$$

Take the fifth root of both sides:

$$
n = (2^{25})^{1/5} = 2^{25/5} = 2^5 = 32
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{32}
$$

So, $2^{10} \cdot 2^{15} = 32^5$, and the integer is $\boxed{32}$.

Okay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer multiple of 30 that only uses the digits 0 and 2. Hmm, let's break this down. First, since the number has to be a multiple of 30, it must be divisible by both 10 and 3. That makes sense because 30 is 10 times 3, and they are coprime. So, the number has to end with a 0 to be divisible by 10, right? And then the sum of its digits has to be a multiple of 3 for divisibility by 3.

Since the number can only have 0s and 2s, and it h

First, since the number has to be a multiple of 30, it must be divisible by both 10 and 3. Divisible by 10 means the last digit has to be 0. So whatever number we come up with, it has to end with a 0. That simplifies things a bit because we know the last digit is fixed. 

Now, the other part is divisibility by 3. For a number to be divisible
